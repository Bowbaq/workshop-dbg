## Prerequisites

Every developer needs a set of tools to work with. These may vary depending on the eco system, but the following steps are
quite common amongst today's cloud developers. Before we jump into action, there are a few tools that need
to be downloaded and installed to and on your PC:

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git works on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.
2. Download [Google's Go Language](https://golang.org/dl/). Go works on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android and other platforms.
3. Download [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?code=IIC).
   If the link provided does not work, try [this one](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). IntelliJ works on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX
   and is one of the most common Integrated Developer Environments (IDE) today.

While these tools are downloading, [set up an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join). You can use any email address you wish. If
you do not want to provide your personal email, you can use a "trash mailer", for example [byom.de](https://www.byom.de/).

## Setting up your development environment

### Git

Git is a Versioning Control System (VCS) developed by Linux founder Linus Torvalds and others. Git was designed because
the Linux Kernel Development got out of hand and a better VCS was needed.

#### Installing Git on Windows

Unfortunately, Microsoft *might* block the installation of Git. This is due to missing certificates, as most open source
projects do not have the resources to buy such an certificate from Microsoft. If you see an error like this one

![](docs/win-prevents-git-install.png)

there is no need to worry. Git has been around for years and is used by hundreds of thousands of developers every day
and is completely open source and peer reviewed. To override the faulty Windows SmartScreen, click on **More info**

![](docs/win-prevents-git-install-override.png)

and press **Run anyway**. Now, the installer should start.

![](docs/git-install-windows.png)

There is no need for customization while installing and you can simply use the default settings
by pressing **Next >**. When the installer is done, you should see this:

![](docs/git-install-windows-success.png)

Congratulations, you have now installed the tool that every developer has on your machine.

#### Installing Git on OSX

### Google's Go Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. It is
developed by Google and was introduced because Google had significant problems maintaining their code base.

Over time, the large scale projects at Google got significantly more complex were increasingly hard to maintain and
scale in aspects of human and computational resources. Go is therefore primarily aimed at companies that process huge
amounts of data in a large, distributed and cloud native way.

Today, six years after release, Go is the backbone of almost every modern, scalable cloud application. Companies like Amazon,
Cloudflare, Spotify or IBM, just to name a few, are using Go in their production systems. Modern infrastructure systems
like Docker, Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes are written primarily in Go.

#### Installing Go on Windows

Installing Go on Windows is straight forward. You can leave all defaults as-is. Once Go is installed, you should
see a screen similar to this one:

![](docs/win-go-install.png)

#### Installing Go on OSX

### JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA

JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE aimed at Java developers. JetBrains has various IDEs for all sorts of programming
languages including Ruby, JavaScript, PHP and others. IntelliJ is my personal favorite and has superb support for Google
Go.

#### Installing JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA on Windows

The set up is straight forward. You can leave all defaults as-is. Once Go is installed, you should see a screen similar to this one:

![](docs/win-intellij-install.png)

#### Installing JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA on OSX

## Wiring it all together

The hardest part is wiring it all together because each environment (your PC) is unique in it's configuration. There
are a couple of things that need to be done now.

### Go on Windows

There are a few things we need to do on Windows to get things running. First, we need to set up your workspace.
To do so, create a `workspace` directory anywhere on your disk. I keep mine in my home directory at
`C:\Users\aeneas\workspace`. Because we are working with go, it is a good idea to create a subdirectory called `go` as
well `C:\Users\aeneas\workspace\go`.

Now we need to tell Go where this directory is by setting up an environment variable. Open the Windows start menu,
search for "environment variables" and click on "Edit the system environment variables":

![](docs/win-env-path-1.png)

![](docs/win-env-path-2.png)

Next, click on "Environment Variables" and then on "New" in the "System variables" section:

![](docs/win-env-path-3.png)

![](docs/win-env-path-4.png)

Now we will set the GOPATH by using `GOPATH` as "Variable name" and the path to your go workspace as "Variable value":

![](docs/win-env-path-5.png)

Congratulations! You just completed setting up Go! Next we will initialize IntelliJ and once that is done, we are ready
to run and modify some code!

### Go on Mac OSX

### IntelliJ on all platforms

Next, we need to set up IntelliJ and Go. The following screens should guide you through the process

![](docs/win-intellij-1.png)

![](docs/win-intellij-2.png)

![](docs/win-intellij-3.png)

Now hit install and "Restart IntelliJ" once the set up has completed.

You are now geared up to check out check out a Git repository, make changes to the code base and push them back
to the cloud!
